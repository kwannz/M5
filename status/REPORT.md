# Sprint-01 Status Report - DeskAgent v1.0

**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Sprint Duration**: Day 1 of 10 (2-week sprint)  
**Overall Progress**: 40% Complete (2/5 modules)  

## 📊 Executive Summary

- ✅ **M1: Orchestrator** - COMPLETE (11/11 tests ✅)
- ✅ **M2: Desktop Control** - COMPLETE (17/17 tests ✅)  
- 🔄 **M3: LLM Router** - STARTING NEXT
- ⏳ **M4: TUI Dashboard** - PENDING
- ⏳ **M5: Workflow Integration** - PENDING

## 🎯 Completed This Period

### M1: Orchestrator (✅ DONE)
- **Core Features**: 5-state task machine (PLAN/REVIEW/STATUS/FOLLOWUP/APPLY)
- **Reliability**: Event logging with replay capability, retry logic
- **Testing**: 11/11 unit tests passing
- **Artifacts**: `src/orchestrator/*.rs`, event logs in `runs/`

### M2: Desktop Control (✅ DONE)
- **macOS Integration**: AppleScript-based Cursor IDE control
- **Terminal Automation**: Command execution with output capture
- **Safety**: Command validation and dangerous operation detection
- **Testing**: 17/17 tests passing (9 unit + 8 integration)
- **DoD Verified**: File navigation ✅, text insertion ✅, command execution ✅

## 🚀 Next Sprint Activities

### Immediate (Next 2-3 days)
1. **M3: LLM Router Implementation**
   - Claude API direct integration  
   - OpenRouter fallback routing
   - Task-type based model selection
   - Cost/latency tracking with `routing/log.jsonl`

### Medium-term (Days 4-6)  
2. **M4: TUI Dashboard**
   - ratatui-based terminal interface
   - Repository/task status display
   - Keyboard shortcuts (P/R/S/F/A)

### Final Phase (Days 7-10)
3. **M5: End-to-end Workflows**
   - Sprint file parsing → LLM planning
   - Desktop control integration
   - Full PLAN→EDIT→REVIEW cycle

## 🔄 Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers: NONE ✅
- All critical foundation modules (M1, M2) working
- Development velocity on track

### Potential Risks (LOW)
- **API Keys**: Need Claude/OpenRouter credentials for M3 testing
- **Model Limits**: Rate limiting may require retry strategies (already planned)
- **Integration Complexity**: M5 workflow complexity may require timeline adjustment

## 📈 Quality Metrics

### Test Coverage: EXCELLENT ✅
- **Total Tests**: 28/28 passing (100% success rate)
- **Coverage**: Complete unit + integration testing
- **Performance**: Build time ~0.9s, test execution ~0.02s

### Code Quality: HIGH ✅
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns (orchestrator, desktop, llm, tui, workflows)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error propagation and recovery
- **Documentation**: Test reports and progress tracking in place

## 📅 Timeline Confidence: HIGH ✅

**On Track**: 40% complete after 1 day of 10-day sprint  
**Velocity**: Exceeding expectations with solid foundation  
**Remaining Work**: 3 modules, increasing complexity but good architecture foundation

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What's Working Well
- **Test-first approach**: Immediate validation of each module
- **Progressive complexity**: Building foundation before advanced features  
- **Platform-specific implementation**: macOS focus for reliable desktop control

### Optimization Opportunities  
- **Parallel development**: M3 and M4 could have overlapping implementation
- **Integration planning**: Early M5 design to influence M3/M4 interfaces

## 🎬 Next Actions

1. **Today**: Begin M3 LLM Router implementation
2. **Tomorrow**: Complete M3 core features and testing
3. **Day 3**: Start M4 TUI Dashboard while M3 is being polished
